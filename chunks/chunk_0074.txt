eBay Money Back Guarantee 
Most eBay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase covered by eBay Money Back 
Guarantee, buyers can get their money back if an item didn't arrive, is faulty or damaged, or doesn't 
match the listing. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any 
eBay Money Back Guarantee case.
